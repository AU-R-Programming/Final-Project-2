# Introduction

The Classification Package offers tools to:

- Perform ```logistic regression``` using numerical optimization.
- Compute ```bootstrap confidence intervals``` for model coefficients.
- Evaluate ```model performance metrics```.

This guide explains the steps to set up and use the package for classification tasks.

## Installation

To use the Classification Package, ensure you have the necessary software environment. Follow these steps to install the package:

A. Pre-requisites:

- Install ```R``` or ```RStudio``` for an interactive coding environment.
- Ensure your system supports necessary libraries for numerical computation.

B. Package Installation:

- ```Download``` and ```install``` the **Classification Package** from its repository or source.

C. Dataset Requirement:

- The package uses datasets like the ```"adult"``` dataset for examples. Ensure to prepare your data in the correct format (e.g., .csv).

## Key Functionalities

**Preprocessing Data**

The package includes tools to prepare your data:

- Normalize numerical features (e.g., Min-Max scaling).
- Encode categorical variables (e.g., One-Hot Encoding).
- Select specific columns for feature variables and target outcomes.

**Logistic Regression**

Fit a logistic regression model using the provided ```logistic_regression()```       function:

- Subset your data for efficient computation.
- Prepare input matrices for the features and target variable.
- Use the function to compute the coefficients of the regression model.

**Bootstrap Confidence Intervals**

Estimate the variability of model coefficients with ```bootstrap_ci()```:

- Perform resampling to compute 95% confidence intervals for the regression coefficients.
- Set parameters such as the number of bootstrap samples and significance levels.

**Model Evaluation**

Evaluate the performance of the fitted model with metrics including:

- Accuracy: Overall model correctness.
- Sensitivity: True positive rate.
- Specificity: True negative rate.
- Confusion Matrix: Summary of prediction results.

## Example Workflow

A. Load and Preprocess Data:

- Import a dataset (e.g., "adult.csv").
- Scale numerical features and encode categorical variables.

B. Model Fitting:

- Use logistic regression to predict outcomes.

C. Confidence Interval Calculation:

- Apply bootstrap methods to estimate confidence intervals for model coefficients.

D. Evaluate Results:

- Predict outcomes on validation data.
- Analyze performance using model evaluation metrics.
