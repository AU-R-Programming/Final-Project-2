\title{Logistic Regression Using Numerical Optimization}
\usage{
logistic_regression(X, y, ridge_penalty = 1e-05)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{A matrix of predictors (including the intercept column, if required).}

\item{y}{A binary response vector (0/1).}

\item{ridge_penalty}{A small constant for ridge regularization to stabilize matrix inversion
(default is \code{1e-5}).}
}
\value{
A named vector of optimized coefficients (\eqn{\beta}).
}
\description{
This function performs logistic regression using numerical optimization with optional ridge regularization
for numerical stability.
}
\examples{
# Example usage:
# Simulated data
set.seed(123)
X <- cbind(1, matrix(rnorm(100 * 2), ncol = 2))  # Add intercept and 2 features
y <- rbinom(100, 1, 0.5)  # Binary response
beta <- logistic_regression(X, y)
print(beta)
